Web user interface for [Cloudigrade](https://github.com/cloudigrade/cloudigrade), based on [Patternfly <img src="https://www.patternfly.org/assets/img/logo.svg" height="30" />](https://www.patternfly.org/)

## Requirements
Before developing for Frontigrade, the basic requirements:
 * Your system needs to be running [NodeJS version 8+](https://nodejs.org/)
 * [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/)
 * And optionally [Yarn 1.5+](https://yarnpkg.com), otherwise NPM should be adequate.

### Docker & Mac
Setting Docker up on a Mac? Install the appropriate package and you should be good to go. To check if everything installed correctly you can try these steps.
  * At a terminal prompt type
 
    ```
    $ docker run hello-world
    ```
    
### Docker & Linux
Setting Docker up on a Linux machine can include an additional convenience step. If you're having to prefix "sudo" in front of your Docker commands you can try these steps.
  * [Docker postinstall documentation](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/linux-postinstall/)
 
## Development

### Installing
  1. Clone the repository
     ```
     $ git clone git@github.com:cloudigrade/frontigrade.git
     ```

  1. Within the Frontigrade repo, install project dependencies
     ```
     $ npm install
     ```

### Development Serve
This is the default context for running the UI with a local mock API
  ```
  $ npm start
  ```
  
Once you've gone through the [Cloudigrade install process](https://github.com/cloudigrade/cloudigrade#developer-environment), and confirmed [tooling for Cloudigrade](https://github.com/cloudigrade/cloudigrade#developer-environment) works you can make use of the local Openshift convenience scripting
  ```
  $ npm run start:oc
  ```

#### Debugging Redux
This project makes use of React & Redux. To enable Redux console logging, within the `[REPO]/client` directory, add a `.env.local` (dotenv) file with the follow line
  ```
  REACT_APP_DEBUG_MIDDLEWARE=true
  ```

Once you've made the change, restart the project and console browser logging should appear.


*Any changes you make to the `.env.local` file should be ignored with `.gitignore`.*

### Unit Testing
To run the unit tests, use this command
  ```
  $ npm test
  ```
  
To run the unit tests with a watch during development
  ```
  $ npm run test:dev
  ```

### Development with a Cloudigrade API toolset
[Cloudigrade](https://github.com/cloudigrade/cloudigrade), with Frontigrade, is laid out with the intent to run
against a specific version of Openshift in production. Frontigrade, currently, uses `.env.development` `dotenv` file to direct the API calls to the 
locally running Openshift and Cloudigrade API.

#### Setup Cloudigrade
To develop the UI with Cloudigrade you'll need:
1. To setup Docker appropriately. [Guidance for working with Openshift can be found on the Github Origin repo](https://github.com/openshift/origin/blob/master/docs/cluster_up_down.md#getting-started). The basics aimed at setting up an insecure registry of 172.30.0.0/16
1. Next, you'll need to install the Openshift-CLI, you can use [homebrew](https://brew.sh/), [see Cloudigrade for exact install directions and CLI version](https://github.com/cloudigrade/cloudigrade#developer-environment), but basically:
   ```
   $ brew update 
   $ brew install [correct version of openshift-cli]
   ```
1. You'll need to Git clone the [Cloudigrade repository](https://github.com/cloudigrade/cloudigrade):
   ```
   $ git clone git@github.com:cloudigrade/cloudigrade.git
   ```
1. Change directories into the cloned Cloudigrade repo, and start the app:
   ```
   $ cd [local Cloudigrade repo]
   $ make oc-clean && make oc-up
   ```
1. From there you should be able to navigate to [https://127.0.0.1:8443](https://127.0.0.1:8443).
1. To power Cloudigrade down run the following while still within the Cloudigrade repo:
   ```
   $ make oc-down
   ```

#### Having issues running Cloudigrade on Openshift locally?
If you're having issues running Cloudigrade on Openshift, run through some of the following solutions.

1. Docker isn't quite playing along. _It should be noted these are extreme, you will be removing data_. You can try **one**, or all of these:
   - `$ docker rmi -f $(docker images -aq)`
   - `$ docker volume rm -f $(docker volume ls -q)`
   - `$ docker rm $(docker ps -qa --no-trunc --filter "status=exited")`
   - `$ docker system prune -a`
2. [You forgot to set some of the AWS environment variables](https://github.com/cloudigrade/cloudigrade#configure-aws-account-credentials). Try running, within the Cloudigrade repo directory context:
   ```
   $ export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=[YOUR KEY ID]
   $ export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=[YOUR ACCESS KEY]
   $ make oc-create-cloudigrade
   $ make oc-up
   ``` 
3. An aspect of Cloudigrade failed to deploy within Openshift. Try running, within the Cloudigrade repo directory context:
   ```
   $ make oc-clean
   $ make oc-up-all
   ```
   You may have to wait a minute or two for the containers to be up and running, you can `$ docker ps` to check.
